## Overview

Satellite remote sensing is the science of converting raw aerial imagery into actionable intelligence about the built and natural environment. In the context of city planning, this is applied to use cases such as building footprint extraction, multi-class object detection (e.g., cars), and land cover/land use classification. This course will provide you the foundation necessary for application of machine learning algorithms on satellite imagery. We will cover the core concepts of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning; model selection; feature engineering; and performance evaluation. The course will cover traditional methods and algorithms as well as recent deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks and their application to semantic image segmentation.

### Objectives

The main learning goal of this class is to provide you with the foundational context and skills necessary for use in machine learning applied to remote sensing and enable you to independently pursue further study and work. We will focus specifically on remote sensing use cases in city planning, with a special emphasis on deep learning applications (e.g., CNNs). You will learn how to define a problem, select appropriate algorithms and tools, design and implement their machine learning models, and apply and validate their models on new datasets.

Given the ready availability of code documentation and AI-generated code, we will emphasize a strong conceptual understanding of remote sensing and machine learning fundamentals. This is a hands-on class involving multiple examples that will be explained and run real-time during the lectures. The course will primarily use Python-based implementations of remote sensing, such as `pystac` and `geemap`, although you will be encouraged to explore other relevant tools on your own.

### Format

The course will be divided into two halves. In the first half of the semester, we will focus on building a strong foundational understanding of remote sensing and machine learning. The second half of the semester will delve into more advanced and specific use cases, such as deep learning and data pipelines.

Most weeks, we will divide class time evenly between lectures and labs. Lectures will focus on a conceptual overview of the material, while labs will offer hands-on time to work on pairs or groups on assignments designed to build remote sensing skills applied to planning-specific use cases, including in-class exercises, homeworks, and the final project.

We try to follow the best practices laid out in [_Teaching Tech Together_](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html), and we treat this class as a living document: we hope that it will evolve and improve over time and--in addition to explicitly seeking student feedback through surveys--we encourage students to submit suggestions for improvements to the class content as feature requests or pull requests on the GitHub repository. (On this note, we encourage you to check out [our roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) to see our plans to develop the course in the future).

### Tips for Success

Based on our experiences teaching (and taking!) this class in previous years, here are a couple pieces of advice for how to approach the class:

First, be patient. Remote sensing and machine learning are big domains, and it will take you a little while to wrap your head around the jargon and the core concepts. We will deliberately return to key topics repeatedly throughout the semester in order to give you a ample opportunity to absorb all of the most important information.

Second, give yourself enough time to complete assignments. Programming always involves a lot of debugging, and this class is no exception. We recommend budgeting at least twice as much time as you _think_ you'll need to complete an assigingment. Trust us--this will save you a lot of stress.

Finally, come ready to explore! Remote sensing and machine learning are massive domains--more than we can possibly cover in one semester. This class is meant to be a launching pad; we hope you'll leave it with a sense of excitement and curiosity about where else remote sensing and machine learning can take you.

### Grading

There are five assignments over the course of the semester: [four homeworks](assignments/), each worth 10% of the overall grade (for a total of 40%) and one [final project](assignments/FINAL_PROJECT.md) worth 40% of the overall grade. A further 20% of the grade is based on participation.

Each homework assignment will involve the implementation of a machine learning application discussed in class. Homework can be started at any time but is due by the end of class by the date indicated on the syllabus. Late homework will be accepted but penalized. You are encouraged to work in groups, but you must submit a homework assignment that is uniquely yours (see our [section on academic integrity](#academic-integrity-and-ai-use)).

For the term project, you will identify and research a machine learning-based remote sensing problem in urban planning. This will involve collecting and organizing the relevant data, implementing your solution of choice, and delivering a lightning talk (five-minute presentation) on your use case in the final week of class. Grading for the final project is not directly dependent on the successful implementation of the solution to the stated problem, but rather on a coherent, thoughtful analysis of the problem and a thorough justification of the chosen solution, including limitations and potential next steps. Like labs and homeworks,term projects should be completed in groups of 2-3.

Homework and final project grades are not directly linked to the accuracy of the final applications. Rather, multiple factors--such as data organization, model selection, and presentation of the results--will be evaluated. Given the ready availability of code documentation and pair programming tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT), the grade for each homework assignment will be divided evenly between the submitted code and the corresponding responses to the analytical questions.

_Extra credit is available for contributions to the class codebase._ We will offer minimally half a bonus point (i.e., an extra 0.5% on your final grade) for every substantive pull request made to improve the repository, with more points awarded at our discretion for larger contributions. This can include improvements to documentation, bug fixes, and example code to be used in future years.

### Software

This course relies on the use of Python and various related packages. All software is open-source and freely available. We will use common tools to facilitate collaboration and ease of use. You are expected to use VSCode, the Google Cloud SDK, Git, `pipenv`, and `pyenv` during the course in order to make sure that weâ€™re all using consistent environments and minimize dependency issues and other kinds of software problems. For information on setting up your environment, see the [setup docs](docs/SETUP.md).

## Academic Integrity and AI Use

All students are expected to comply with with Penn's [Code of Academic Integrity](http://www.upenn.edu/academicintegrity/ai_codeofacademicintegrity.html), and obvious copying is prohibited. That said, this course relies extensively on [pair programming](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-pair-programming/) and aims to prepare you for real-world work. So, you are encouraged to learn how to collaborate effectively and use the internet and other sources to support your work, so long as you attribute it clearly when adapting large chunks of code or other material from other sources. In cases where this is unclear, please make sure to attribute your source.

Relatedly, we have no issue with using AI tools to help with coding (note: you have all have [free GitHub Copilot access as long as you are students](https://education.github.com/pack)). That said, when using any of these tools, you are subject to the standard citation guidelines. Also, be aware that AI tools are subject to mistakes, especially as you get deeper into specialized technical tools. If you are too reliant on these tools, you run the risk of wasting time debugging nonsense code, or not understanding the underlying strucure of what you're writing. Ultimately, it's in your best interest to learn to use AI tools as _tools_--not as replacements for critical thinking--and to learn how to use them _intelligently and effectively_.
